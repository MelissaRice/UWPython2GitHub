Contents of Subdirectory:

Week02LabA1.py: 
  First half of Lab A: use urllib2 to download and save a url: 
  http://briandorsey.info/uwpython/week01/email_vm.py
  The contents of the url is saved to Week02LabA1-Output.txt and
  some metadata is printed to the console.

Week02LabA1-Output.txt: 
  Output file for Week02LabA1.py.
    
Week02LabA2.py: 
  Second half of Lab A: write a program which reads a text file with a single 
  URL on each line and attempts to save each to a file. The input file is urls.txt
  and the output files are url1.html and url2.html.
  
urls.txt:
  Input file for Week02LabA1.py containing urls (one per line).
  
url1.html and url2.html: 
  Output files for Week02LabA1.py containing the contents of the urls from 
  urls.txt, respectively.    

Week02LabB.py: 
  Exploration of a very basic webserver; assignment was to add code which serves
  the current time as an html page in response to a request for the /time url.
  
Week02Assignment.py: 
  Modify the 30 minute webserver as follows:
  - for py files, run the file and serve the output (as text)
  - test with time_print.py (I renamed to time_print_txt.py)
  - update time_print.py to output html  (time_print_html.py)
  
time_print_txt.py:
  Originally called time_print.py this is a test file for the assignment. 
  I renamed it to clarify that it generates text output.
  
time_print_html.py:
  The modification of time_print.py to output html.
